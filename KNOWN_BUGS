Sorting of categories is incorrect when using non-english characters

    The sorting isn't correct for 책 and 채. 채 comes before 책. Is it possible to
    fix that?

    The problem with unicode is that it has no knowledge about an alphabet. I
    am note sure how Python does the comparison, but it seems like the English
    alphabet is correctly sorted. Maybe with the exception that upper case are
    sorted before lower case?

    This is a difficult problem. Even if we can sort by a particular alphabet
    (which I think is not supported by Python at the moment), how do we choose
    which alphabet? Maybe getting the locale from the user's computer is one
    option.

Using an extended calendar causes some problems

    Some are discussed here:

    I think that the year 0 dont exist... between 1 bc and 1ad like (...5 4 3 2
    1 1 2 3 4 5...) the same for "Century 0" please take in mind this...

    "Year zero" does not exist in the widely used Gregorian calendar or in its
    predecessor, the Julian calendar. Under those systems, the year 1 BC is
    followed by AD 1.

    One suggestion I have is to change AD/BC to BCE/CE.  It's becoming the
    accepted standard since many do not practice a Christian faith, and those
    of us who do can find through research that Jesus wasn't actually born in
    the 0 year.

    Another comment from a user:

    There is a concept called epochs used to denote different periods in time.
    Perhaps that is something we should incorporate in timeline.

    Or we should just make the gregorian calendar work better when extended.
