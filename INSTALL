If that is not available for your platform, instructions for installing from
source follows below.

Installing prerequisites on a Debian-based system
-------------------------------------------------

Note: If your version of wxPython is less than 2.8.9.2 you need to install a
newer version. Check out this wiki page for instructions how to do that:
http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian.

  apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8 wx2.8-i18n python-markdown
  apt-get install scons gettext

You have to install iCalendar manually since there is no Debian packages for
it. See section below.

Installing gettext on Windows
-----------------------------

Get the zipfiles gettext-tools-0.17.zip and gettext-runtime-0.17-1.zip from
here http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/.

Installing iCalendar
--------------------

The easiest way to install iCalendar is to download the source code from its
website and then copy the iCalendar-2.1/src/icalendar folder to the root folder
of Timeline. Or you can follow their installation instructions.

The important thing is that you can do 'import icalendar' from Python.

Platforms
=========

Timeline has been tested on Windows and Linux.

If you are experiencing problems with a different platform, please send an
email to the user mailing list thetimelineproj-user@lists.sourceforge.

Install and Start Timeline
==========================

To install the translations, run this command:

  cd <path-to-timeline-directory>
  scons mo

To run the application, use this command:

  python <path-to-timeline-directory>/timeline.py

Preferable you create a shortcut on your platform that issues this command.
