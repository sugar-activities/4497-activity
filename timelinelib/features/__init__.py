Defines and handle Timeline features.

A feature in Timeline can come in several flavours.
   * Installed
   * Experimental

An installed feature is functionality that is built and implemented in
Timeline. A Timeline user can give feedback on an installed feature
through a menu selection in the Help menu.

An experimental feature is functionality that we want to test and see
how it works and how it is liked by the users. It is not yet decided
if it will become a part of Timeline.
The user has the option to switch an experimental feature on or off
in the Timeline Edit->Preferences dialog.
As with installed features the user can give feedback on experimental
features through a menu selection in the Help menu.
