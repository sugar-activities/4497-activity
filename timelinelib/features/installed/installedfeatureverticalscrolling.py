DESCRIPTION = """
             This new feature enables you to scroll the Timeline events vertically.
             You accomplish this by pressing the Ctrl+Shift keys and then scroll the mouse wheel.
             Point events and period events are scrolled in opposite directions and disappear
             from view when they cross the divider line.
