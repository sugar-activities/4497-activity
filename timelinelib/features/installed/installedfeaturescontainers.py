DESCRIPTION = """
             Containers are a way to group events together.
             In a container events can not overlap, so if you add a new event to a container
             all other events are moved to give room for the new event. The same thing happens
             if you resize an event within the container.

             Have a look at this video for a demo. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBwEQ3vqB_I
